# Haunted-House
An object-oriented programming project

This is a command line game in which the objective is to escape a haunted house. You will have to collect items, explore different rooms, and interact with the house to escape. 

This project showcases the use of object-oriented programming concepts in C++. The abstract Space class will represent the different rooms of the house and there are a total of 10 rooms to visit which are children of the Space class. 

The Player class holds the current players location, a Space*, and the player inventory; a vector of strings up to 5 items. There are methods on getting the inventory, the inventory length, and the current location.

Compile the program by typing 'make main' and run the program by typing './main'
